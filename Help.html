                                 it’s finally possible to hold down a top-tier job (and pay) from anywhere in the world. And it has the potential to
                                  transform society by offering equal
                                 pay regardless of location – not to mention helping the environment by eliminating the daily commute.</p>

                               <p>Firstly, we have a lot of positions to recruit for, and often have multiple roles to fill with similar titles.
                                    Secondly, external recruitment platforms like LinkedIn don’t offer a way to post a job without a location. 
                                    So, in order to find people all over the world, we need to run ads in multiple locations.

                                <p>Steamlance’s model is different, and listing the pay for each position is our hallmark.
                                     Most companies can’t do this because they don’t want to set the pay until they know who they’re hiring.
                                      Different candidates may get different offers – and employees in the same role may be paid wildly different rates.
                                       At Steamlance, we require all our clients to set a value for every vacant position,
                                        and to pay that amount to the best candidate – regardless of where they live or what they’ve been paid in the past.
                                     This is inherently fairer because it removes the opportunity for bias. It’s the only way to guarantee equal pay for equal work, always.</p>

                                <p>We work with companies whose objective is to employ the smartest 1% of professional talent in the world. We’ve discovered that the most reliable way to attract the best people is to offer the best pay. Additionally, because all positions are 100% remote, 
                                    our clients reduce overheads like rent and office snacks. These savings are then passed on to the workers.

                                <p>Steamlance’s clients are required to offer equal pay for equal work, always. This means new hires are never 
                                    paid more than existing team members, or vice versa. This unfortunately means it’s not possible to 
                                    pay performance-based bonuses or annual increases which would lead to inequality – particularly when
                                     everyone we hire is a high-performer. The good
                                     news is that this is all taken into account when the pay is set, and the same above-market remuneration package is offered to everyone.</p>

                               <p>Interviews are the final stage in Steamlance’s recruitment process for good reason. Traditional recruitment is full of opportunities
                                    for unconscious bias; from resumé to interview to salary negotiation. Steamlance aims to create the fairest pipeline by removing
                                     as many of these opportunities as possible. So, a lot of the process is automated, and the parts that can’t be are graded blindly
                                      (reviewers score submissions without seeing name, country, gender etc). That’s how Steamlance can guarantee an objectively unbiased 
                                      shortlist. But, of course we understand that it’s important for
                                    candidate and hiring manager to meet before an offer is made, so that’s why our process does include this as the final step.</p>

Of course, we understand that there’s more to being a great worker than that – that’s why the next step is for the shortlisted candidates to complete skill and real-world work assessments curated for the position.

                                     Contractors receive full pay while completing training. Many Steamlance contractors also receive further training
                                      (e.g. AWS certification) as part of their role, 
                                    which is facilitated by the hiring company – though as a general rule we hire subject matter experts who are already equipped for the role.</p>

                                <p>WorkSmart was invented to be like a fitbit for working. It’s a time management and productivity tool created by Steamlance. 
                                    Contractors don’t need to create timesheets or invoices because WorkSmart automates this. Like a fitbit,
                                     it offers a lot of coaching value as a way to objectively measure and improve productivity over time. 
                                     Depending on the settings agreed upon by the client company and hiring manager, WorkSmart has the ability to take screenshots,
                                      as well as snapshots via your webcam, at regular intervals. We recognize that this can be intimidating at first,
                                       but it is ultimately not so different to a typical office environment where people work in view of each other. 
                                    Contractors have full access to review their own timecards (and can remove them if necessary).</p>
